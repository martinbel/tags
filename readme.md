# Code usage

## File preprocessing

1) Run cut_script.sh in the terminal: 
This will generate a file for the tags, title and body
called tags.csv, title.csv and body.csv. It will also output the tail of the body, 
in a file called body_tail.csv.

2) Run read_cut.R in order to find the relevant tags for modelling, and keep the
titles and body that match those tags.
